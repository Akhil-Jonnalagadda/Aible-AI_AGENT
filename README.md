## 1. Introduction to Aible

Aible is an **AI platform designed for business users and organizations**. It helps people use Artificial Intelligence to solve real-world problems **without needing deep coding or data science skills**.

Unlike traditional AI tools that only make predictions, **Aible focuses on business impact**. It doesn’t just tell you *what will happen*; it advises you on *what to do next* and *how much benefit you’ll get*.

Think of it as a **virtual AI business coach** that works alongside your team.

## 5. Real-Time Example: Online Clothing Store

**Problem:** Many customers buy once but never return → churn is high.

**Using Aible:**

1. Upload customer data: age, number of purchases, complaints.
2. Set goal: reduce churn by 15% within budget.
3. Aible finds patterns:

   * Customers with <3 purchases and complaints → 70% likely to leave.
   * Long-term customers with no complaints → very low churn.
4. Predictions:

   * John = 90% likely to leave.
   * Sarah = 10% likely to leave.
5. Suggestions:

   * Offer John a 20% coupon → keep him → expected +\$200 profit.
   * No coupon for Sarah → she will stay anyway.
6. Business Impact:

   * Spending \$5,000 on coupons saves \$15,000 in profits.

**Result:** Clear action plan that saves money and reduces churn.
